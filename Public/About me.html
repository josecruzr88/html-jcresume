    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="../Assets/Images/Albania.png" height="300" alt="Jose Carlos sitting on a stone at the Albanian Alps">
        <p>I am a communication and project management professional passionate about turning ideas into tangible results. 
            Throughout my career, I have learned that organization, empathy, and clarity are the foundation of meaningful progress. 
            For me, every project is like a summit to be reached step by step, with perseverance, focus, and teamwork.</p>
        <p>I have worked in international and multicultural environments, coordinating communication, marketing, and technology projects. 
            My experience at global companies such as the Coca-Cola group taught me how to balance creativity with structure and maintain clear 
            communication across teams with different perspectives and priorities.</p>
        <p>In recent years, I have focused on projects that combine strategy, automation, and content. I am particularly interested in how 
            technology, from agile methodologies to artificial intelligence, can improve processes, enhance collaboration, and optimize the way 
            we communicate.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I am driven by curiosity and the desire to keep learning, whether exploring new places, hiking, or 
        taking on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone. I value experiences that bring perspective and connection, both 
        individually and with others. Currently, I am expanding my professional profile by completing a web development course to 
        strengthen my technical skills and open new opportunities for growth in the digital field.</p>
